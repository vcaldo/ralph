# Ralph - Automated Iterative Development with Claude

Ralph is an automation workflow that uses Claude to systematically work through complex development tasks by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces. Based on the [Ralph technique](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/brief-history-of-ralph), it enables autonomous, iterative development with full visibility and control.

**TL;DR:**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code
brew install jq  # or: apt install jq

# Verify setup
claude --version
git config user.name
git config user.email

# Create your first plan
cp TODO.example.md plans/my-feature/TODO.md
./ralph.sh plans/my-feature/ 999
```
---

## Quick Start

### 1. Plan Your Feature

Ask Claude to plan a big feature or refactor. For example:

```
Implement a telegram bot that sends me a message every time my ipcam
uploads an image to /home/user/cam/. Send the photo with timestamp
and delete the photo after confirmation from telegram API that the
photo was sent.
```

### 2. Locate and Organize the Plan

Find the most recent plan generated by Claude:

```bash
ls -ltr ~/.claude/plans/
```

Copy the plan to your project's plans directory:

```bash
# Create a descriptive plan directory inside your repo
mkdir -p plans/ip-cam-telegram-bot

# Copy the plan file
cp ~/.claude/plans/your-plan-file.md plans/ip-cam-telegram-bot/

# Copy the TODO template
cp TODO.example.md plans/ip-cam-telegram-bot/TODO.md
```

### 3. Break Down the Plan

Start a new Claude session and ask Calude to brea down the plan into actionable tasks:

```
I have a plan at plans/ip-cam-telegram-bot/plan.md.
Please read it and update the TODO.md in the same folder,
breaking down the plan into small, actionable tasks organized by priority.
```

### 4. Run Ralph

Execute the automation script to let Claude work through your tasks:

```bash
./ralph.sh plans/ip-cam-telegram-bot/ 999
```

Watch Ralph work through your TODO list, making commits and tracking progress automatically.

### 5. Monitor Progress

In another terminal, monitor progress in real-time:

```bash
tail -f plans/ip-cam-telegram-bot/progress.txt
```

## How It Works

Ralph follows a simple loop:

1. Reads tasks from `TODO.md` in your plan directory
2. Picks the highest-priority incomplete task
3. Works on **only that task**
4. Marks the task complete and updates `progress.txt`
5. Auto-commits changes to git
6. Repeats until all tasks are complete or iterations exhausted

## Features

- **Autonomous Development**: Claude works independently through your task list
- **Single Task Focus**: One task at a time for quality and clarity
- **Git Integration**: Auto-commits with descriptive messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logs and metrics
- **Flexible Planning**: Works with any task breakdown
- **Safe by Design**: Operates in your development environment, not production

## Requirements

- [Claude CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/claude-code) installed and configured
- Git with user identity configured
- `jq` for JSON processing
- Bash shell

## The Ralph Technique

Ralph is based on the [Ralph technique](https://www.humanlayer.dev/blog/brief-history-of-ralph) - a pattern for breaking down complex software development tasks into systematic, automatable steps that an AI agent can execute independently while maintaining quality and visibility.
